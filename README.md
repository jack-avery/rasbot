rasbot is designed modularly and allows you to add to the base application easily with *"plug-and-play"*-style extensions. You can see some sample modules, **including** built-in functions in the `modules` folder.

To include a module as part of a command, encompass the module name in `&`, e.g.:
```
r!cmdadd np &np&
```
