The previous update (2.24.0) does not include any breaking changes.

- osu! requests module now allows you to set a cooldown per-user in the module config
- For module developers, definitions now includes NO_MESSAGE_SIGNAL to tell the bot not to send anything no matter what
- Fixed module.cfg_get being broken

This update (2.25.0) does not include any breaking changes.

For module developers, modules now should declare 'consumes' and use self.get_args(), instead of accessing or modifying self.bot.cmdargs.
This helps multiple modules in one command (if it ever happens) interact more predictably.
