The previous update (2.25.0) does not include any breaking changes.

- Fixed shutting down the bot with Ctrl+C not working with the XP module imported.
- request module now includes subscriber (and VIP/moderator) only mode. Use "!request submode" to toggle.
For module developers, modules now should declare 'consumes' and use self.get_args().
This helps multiple modules in one command (if it ever happens) interact more predictably.

This update (2.26.0) does not include any breaking changes.

More options have been given for requests format, removing it from the fixed default.
For the old look, add "&requester& requested: " to the start of your message_format.
You can now add &requesterstatus& which will tell you the status of the user:
Host -> Moderator -> VIP -> Sub -> User
